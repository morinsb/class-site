                <h3>Some things I've done:</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Institute for Molecular Engineering</h4>
    <p>Working with a team of two of my peers under Professor Juan de Pablo, I helped to independently design, prototype and successfully build an apparatus that biaxially stretches polymers at two-micron increments. I learned how to proficiently use OnShape, a cloud-based CAD software, how to operate 3D printers (at the Polsky Exchange North) and build relationships with team members and scientific equipment suppliers.</p>
<br>
<h4>Science Team</h4>
<p> joined our school’s science team Sophomore year. I was chosen to be a captain junior year, and helped the team recover from a disappointing performance the previous season. As of now, we have qualified for four different state competitions</p>
<br>
<h4>Sailing</h4>
<p>I have sailed (skippering and crewing) for both club events (representing Columbia Yacht Club) and our high school. I was a founding member of our sailing team sophomore year, and was promoted to captain for senior year. We've qualified for the Great Lakes Championship in three consecutive years, and the Great Oaks National Invitational junior year.</p>
<br>
<h4>Apricity OS</h4>
<p>Co-founded Apricity OS, a company that develops and distributes an Arch-Linux based operating system that aims to provide a user-friendly interface to beginners, and customizability attractive to power-users. Our efforts have been successful, and we reached over 300,000 users before shutting down the company (due to my partner graduating).</p>
<br>
<h4>Boy Scouts</h4>
<p>I've been a member of my local Boy Scout troop, Troop 599, since I was twelve years old. I love being a member of this troop, as it gives me a way to actively engage in my community and spend time in the outdoors. Our troop consistently gives back to our community, whether it be volunteering at local nonprofits or helping civic organizations. While I love community service, my favorite part of being in this troop is its effort to spend time outdoors. I love Chicago, but it's great to get outdoors. In addition to regular camping trips, I have traveled to both Philmont and Sea Base. Currently I hold the rank of Life Scout, and am close to earning my Eagle rank.</p><br>

<h4>React</h4>
<p>I joined this community service club freshman year. Sophomore year I was promoted to Vice President and Junior year to President. We work with a number of local organizations, including the Matthew House, the Ronald McDonald House and Inspiration Corporation. As president, I've expanded the number of organizations we collaborate with, and increased the number of leadership positions available. By doing this, we've been able to foster more relationships with local nonprofits and make a larger difference in the community. </p>

<h4>Maroon Key Society</h4>
<p>Faculty nominated me for MKS Junior year, and I help my school by speaking with prospective parents, students and communicating with alumni. I really enjoy giving tours of our school and try to help out wherever possible.
</p>
<br>
<h4>South East Chicago Commission</h4>
<p>During my sophomore year, I volunteered at the South East Chicago Commission, a non-profit in Hyde Park that aims to support small businesses on the Southside and hosts community focused events. While there, I wrote and formatted their final report, created PowerPoint’ss for their board meetings, and assisted with general administrative work.
