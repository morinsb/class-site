    <p>Working with a team of two of my peers under Professor Juan de Pablo, I helped to independently design, prototype and successfully build an apparatus that biaxially stretches polymers at two-micron increments. I learned how to proficiently use OnShape, a cloud-based CAD software, how to operate 3D printers (at the Polsky Exchange North) and build relationships with team members and scientific equipment suppliers.</p>
