    <p>I joined this community service club freshman year. Sophomore year I was promoted to Vice President and Junior year to President. We work with a number of local organizations, including the Matthew House, the Ronald McDonald House and Inspiration Corporation. As president, I've expanded the number of organizations we collaborate with, and increased the number of leadership positions available. By doing this, we've been able to foster more relationships with local nonprofits and make a larger difference in the community.</p>
