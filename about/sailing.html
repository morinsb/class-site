    <p>I have sailed (skippering and crewing) for both club events (representing Columbia Yacht Club) and our high school. I was a founding member of our sailing team sophomore year, and was promoted to captain for senior year. We've qualified for the Great Lakes Championship in three consecutive years, and the Great Oaks National Invitational junior year.</p>
