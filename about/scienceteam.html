    <p>I joined our schoolâ€™s science team Sophomore year. I was chosen to be a captain junior year, and helped the team recover from a disappointing performance the previous season. We won first place in Envirothon State, qualified for TEAMS Nationals, and placed 8th at Illinois Science Olympiad State, our best showing in over nine years.</p>
